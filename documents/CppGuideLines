C++ Coding Guidelines.
1.	Naming Convention

•	Types: Names representing types must be in mixed case starting with upper case.
Example: Block, BlockChain

•	Variables: Variable names must be in mixed case starting with lower case.
Example: block, blockChain

•	Constants: Named constant must be in all upper case using underscore to separate the words. .
Example: MAX_ITERATION, COLOR_RED, PI

•	Template: Names representing template types must be in single upper case letter.
Example: template<class T> 

•	Methods/Functions: Names represent method/function must be mixed in case and start with lower case.
Example: getAddress(), computeGrandTotal()

•	Class Variables: Private class variables should have m_ underscore prefix.
Example:  private: m_block;

•	Generic Variables: variables should have the same name as their type.
Example:  void setBlock(Block* block)

•	Plural form should be used on names representing a collection of objects.
Example:  int   values[];

•	The prefix is should be used for boolean variables and methods.
Example: isVisible;

•	The prefix n should be used for variables representing a number of objects.
Example:  nLines
